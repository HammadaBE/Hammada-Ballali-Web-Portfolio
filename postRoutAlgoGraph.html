		<h3>Modelling network disruption in link-state and distance-vector network simulations</h3>

		<p>The main objective of this study is to compare the performance in the application of the two most important computer network 
			communication routing protocols at a purely computational level by simulating computer networks in a controlled environment 
			that allows a comparison in different environments and altering the factors required to cause interruptions in the network 
			that allow evaluating and analysing the efficiency in the performance of both approaches when drawing a route and reprogramming 
			another route at home if there is a failure in the network.
		<br>
		<br>
		The objectives of this project are as follows:

	 Implement a graphical interface that allows the user to indicate the number of nodes and edges in a network, as well as visualize the resulting network.

	Create a certain number of networks, each one more complex, with more nodes and more edges.

	 Apply to each network different routing algorithms that allow defining the shortest path to transport a packet from the first node to the last one.

	Measure the necessary execution time of each of the algorithms.

	Collect the results in an excel file to later be able to visualize their evolution using matplotlib.

	Analyse the results and compare the efficiency of the different algorithms before and after the network failure.
