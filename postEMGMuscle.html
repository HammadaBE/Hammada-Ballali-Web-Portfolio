		<h3>Undergraduate Summer Scholarship Development of EMG-driven GUI</h3>

		<p>The proposal of this research is to create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that allows the end-user 
			to control an external device through muscle contractions. A muscle sensor (i.e. Myoware EMG) is applied
			to measure and plot the muscle contraction signals derived from the movement of the user upper limb and 
			then control an external servo motor through these movements by means of a low-cost Arduino board. 
			The final purpose of the project will be to design a controller for a Robotic and/or Prosthetic Hand.
		<br>
		<br>
		In the first section a Walfront EMG sensor will be used to get the signals. 
		This device will send a unique signal rectified and amplified, which will be plotted.
		In the second section, a Myoware sensor will be used to get the signals. 
		This device will send two signals. One RAW signal, which is the original detected signal, 
		and a second signal which is a rectified and amplified signal.
		<br>
		<br>
		It was done in 2022.
